# Conquering responsive layouts template

A simple template to hold all your notes for the [Conquering responsive layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course by [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/).

If you choose to use this template and run into any issues, do let me know - I will be using it personally throughout the course, however I might be oblivious to some mistakes.
Also, goes without saying, feel free to take this and modify it with your own needs, some of the sub-chapters are not included (like solutions for example) as these should be reflected in your code later on.

`Most importantly, enjoy the course and have a great day wherever you are reading this from :)`


## How to use

Simply open this markdown file in edit mode, or clone it directly to your own device, copy everything from the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents) section onwards and fill it in as you make notes throughout the course.
